	****How to Play****

2 players / Choose a Deck (Eclipse or Lokyst)

Players will take turns creating strategic placements
Simply click on the card that you want to be purchased and then place them in either combat or base lane.
clicking on any purchased card will stage the card, and then you click on any location that is open to place that said card
once you have used all tech and spawn points you are not able to click on anymore 
use the cute interface to switch players so that player 2 can place their cards on the map
